# Very WIP twin stick shooter with a not-so-subtle polygonal theme.
Current build can be found on the github pages [page](https://jmspae.github.io/ctri/).

## Current features
* Mediocre stable indexing w masking and mask indexing
* Crappy "physics" system with SAT and dead-simple collision resolution.
